\title{Avoiding Undesired Behavior in Concurrent Data Structures}
\author{Jeremy Khawaja}
\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
		The key to avoiding inefficiency and inconsistency in concurrently accessed structures is having well-defined concurrency control patterns to utilize in  orchestrating access procedures. There are many approaches available to use for organizing concurrent access to a data structure. We devise a method using dependency graphs to manage arbitrarily complex spatial and temporal shared access to a data structure.
