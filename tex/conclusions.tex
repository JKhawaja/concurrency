\section{Conclusion}

Future versions of these concepts could apply to systems with multiple concurrent-data structures being accessed by some set of processes. For example, UIs could address nodes and edges from multiple concurrent-data structures. And thus, various access procedures could perform multiple operations on multiple concurrent-data structures within a single acidic procedure (thread).
