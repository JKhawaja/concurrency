How are we going to assign unique-independent modifications to a thread? In other words, how will we ensure that a thread is only allowed to make modifications to a single unique-independent?

We will also address the atomicity of operations and sequence of operations as defined \textit{internally} to a thread.

Since a leaf boundary node is a node without dependencies it can always iterate through its atomic operations infinitely often without waiting for other nodes.
